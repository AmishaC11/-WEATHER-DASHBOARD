*PROJECT DESCRIPTION*- The Weather Dashboard is a dynamic and interactive web application developed as part of my internship to demonstrate proficiency in React.js, RESTful API integration, and user-centric UI development. The application allows users to view real-time weather data for any global location, providing a convenient and visually appealing interface for accessing current conditions and short-term forecasts.

The primary goal of this project was to build a responsive dashboard using React.js that fetches weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API and presents it in an intuitive format. By combining React’s component-based architecture with modern styling and asynchronous JavaScript, the application provides accurate, fast, and structured weather data to users.

When a user enters a city name, the application sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data. The returned data includes key weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather condition (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy), and associated icons. Additionally, the app displays a 4-day forecast to help users plan ahead. The temperature is presented in Celsius, and the weather icons enhance readability and visual engagement.

Development Workflow and Technologies Used-
Frontend: The application was built using React.js, leveraging hooks like useState and useEffect to manage data fetching and re-rendering of components. The interface is styled using CSS3 to ensure clarity and responsiveness across screen sizes.

API Integration: The OpenWeatherMap API was used to retrieve real-time weather and forecast data. The application sends HTTP requests using JavaScript’s fetch() API and handles asynchronous responses using async/await.

Error Handling: If the user enters an invalid city name or the API fails to respond, the application gracefully handles the error by displaying an informative message instead of crashing or remaining blank.

Component Structure: The app was modularly designed with components such as:

SearchBar – for user input

CurrentWeather – to display present conditions

ForecastCards – to show the upcoming 4-day forecast in card format

Loader/ErrorMessage – for improved user experience during data fetching or input errors.

Features:
Real-Time Weather Display
Instantly shows current weather conditions for any city, including location, temperature, weather type, and more.

Forecast Functionality
Displays a 4-day weather forecast, allowing users to plan based on upcoming weather conditions.

Responsive and Accessible UI
Designed with responsive layout principles, making the dashboard accessible on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Live API Integration
Interacts with live data sources via OpenWeatherMap API, ensuring up-to-date information.

Learning Outcomes and Benefits-
This project enhanced my understanding of asynchronous programming in JavaScript, effective state management in React, and working with third-party REST APIs. It also provided practical experience in handling real-time data, designing interactive UIs, and debugging live issues. Moreover, the project offered insight into building modular, maintainable front-end applications—an essential skill in professional development.
